<p style="text-align:center"> <h1 style="text-align:center">JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE </h1></p>
<br/>

<p style="text-align:center">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
 The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. 
As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. 
The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. 
As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, 
however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

As of September 2022, Java 19 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
 Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.
 The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.
 Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.</p>

<p>  <h3>PRINCIPLES :</h3><br/>
There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:
It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
It must be robust and secure.
It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
It must execute with high performance.

It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</p>
